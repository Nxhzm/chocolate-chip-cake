Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, grease and flour two 8 inch round cake pans

In the bowl of your mixer add the dry ingredients, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Hand whisk for at least 30 seconds so the ingredients are well combined.

In a separate bowl, add the eggs, buttermilk and vanilla. Stir with a fork to combine.

With the mixer on low speed gradually add the slices of butter, a few pieces at a time. Increase the mixer to medium speed and beat until the dry ingredients look crumbly and moistened by the butter. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.

Add 1/2 of the egg mixture, beating at medium ( do not beat above medium ) for 1 1/2 minutes, the batter will become thick and fluffy. 

Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the remaining egg mixture in 2 pourings, beating for 20 seconds after each addition.

Fold in the chocolate chips.

Bake at 350 degrees for 30 - 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few crumbs attached.

Let the cake cool in the pans 10 minutes, then turn out.

Makes 7 cups batter.
